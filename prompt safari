A collection of prompts, reflections, 
and experiments as I explore AI, 
language models, and what it means to
be a curious learner.

## ðŸ”¹ Prompt Idea #1: Self-Reflection
**Prompt**: "What are three things 
I learned today, and how could 
I apply them tomorrow?"

## ðŸ”¹ Prompt Idea #2: Mental Model
**Prompt**: "Explain a complex idea
in simple terms, like you're 
talking to a 10-year-old."

## ðŸ§  Notes
- I want to get better at prompt
design.
- I'm exploring how prompts affect
AI responses.
- I plan to experiment with tone, 
length, and framing.
