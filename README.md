# prompt-journal-Welcome to My Prompting Lab ðŸ§ª

I'm Leslie. I'm not a coder, but Iâ€™m deep into learning about prompt engineering, AI tools, mental wellness, and life strategies.

This is my public notebook to store thoughts, discoveries, and experiments as I learn and grow.

## Goals
- Sharpen my prompting skills
- Document AI tools I explore
- Reflect on how tech blends with wellbeing and curiosity
